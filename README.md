Let's Eat Project
I developed an application to assist people in choosing a random restaurant when that indecisive moment arrives of selecting one. The idea was brought by my roommates and I during one of those moments of deciding where we are going to get food. Itâ€™s a fun little project that my roommates and I have enjoyed thus far.
